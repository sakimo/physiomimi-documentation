> Physio-MIMI (Multi-Modality, Multi-Resource Information Integration environment) is an NCRR-funded, multi-CTSA site project designed to develop novel, flexible informatics methodologies, tools and infrastructure to facilitate the collection, management, and analysis of clinical and physiological data.

> Physio-MIMI supports collaborative clinical and translational research using diverse data types across institutions. It builds upon, integrates, and extends two existing informatics initiatives: MIMI (CWRU) and Honest Broker (University of Michigan). MIMI is a web-based data and research management system that consists of three conceptually independent but interconnected servers: Meta-Server, Application Server and Data Resource Server.
