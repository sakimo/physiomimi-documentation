## Physio-MIMI Overview

Physio-MIMI (Multi-Modality, Multi-Resource Information Integration environment) is an NCRR-funded, multi-CTSA site project designed to develop novel, flexible informatics methodologies, tools and infrastructure to facilitate the collection, management, and analysis of clinical and physiological data.

## Physio-MIMI VISAGE Interface
VISAGE (VISual AGgregator and Explorer) is the query interface developed for Physio-MIMI. The goal is for VISAGE to be directly used by clinical researchers, for activities such as data exploration seeking to formulate, clarify, and determine the availability of support for potential hypotheses as well as for cohort identification for clinical trials.

VISAGE has two main components:
<ol>
  <li>Query Builder, with terminology support and visual controls such as slider bar and checkboxes;</li>
  <li>Query Manager, which stores and labels queries for reuse and sharing.</li>
</ol>
